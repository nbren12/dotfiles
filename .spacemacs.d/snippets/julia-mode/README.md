# Collection of YAsnippets for Julia

"[YASnippet](https://github.com/capitaomorte/yasnippet) is a template system for Emacs."

## Notes

- If Julia is used within ESS this snippets may collide with
  snippets for R, because both run in the same major mode `ess-mode`.

- The docstring versions for `type` and `immutable` are not "smart" yet.
