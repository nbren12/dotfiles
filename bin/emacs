# Revisions
# 1.0 - first version to be included with Aquamacs [2007-03-17 David Reitter] 
# 1.1 - delayed deletion of new files [2008-11-12 David Reitter]
# 1.2 - remove hard-coding of application path; consequently, remove sudo functionality
#     - shorter delay before deleting file
# 1.3 - changed application name (Aquamacs 2.0)

# to-do: re-implement in C (or as a shell script)

# $app_path = '/Applications/Aquamacs.app';
# $app_path = '<AQUAMACS-PATH>';
# $pid = qx"ps auxc | awk '/^$ENV{'USER'} .* Aquamacs\$/ {print \$2}'";

 # there is still an issue:
 # if the sudo emacs is still open, it will 
 # call 'open' and open the files in the wrong
 # emacs process.

#  {
    # we can only call "open" with existing files.
    # that's why we create them just for the "open" call.
